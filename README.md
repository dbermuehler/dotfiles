Installation
============

For installation use the dots.sh script. It needs an installation file as an argument. A template for an installation
file can be found in bin/install.template. There you can specify in an associative array, named DOTFILES, which
files/directories from the repo you want to be installed. You also have to specify the path to the dotfile directory.
