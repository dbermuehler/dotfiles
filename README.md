Installation
============

For installation use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). It's excellent for managing symlinks from the
dotfile folder to the real location of the dotfiles.

For a tutorial how to use Stow have a look at this [blog entry](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html) from Brandon Invergo.
